guess the number in n attempts is a simple game we used to play in school, i used java to develop it,
in this game a input window will pop-up and ask for a number betwen 1-100.
it randomly generate a number between 1-100 and you have to guess it in 10 attempts.
if you guess it under 10 attempts you will win otherwise game will over.
